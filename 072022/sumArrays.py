#<8 kyu> Sum Arrays
# by richardhsu

# Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers.
# The numbers can be negative or non-integer. If the array does not contain any numbers then you should return 0.

# Simple sum of arrays, a for range and sum variable would work also.

def sum_array(a):
  return sum(a)
